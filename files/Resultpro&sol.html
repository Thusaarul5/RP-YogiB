            <!-- The traditional yoga teaching method involves students imitating postures after an instructor,
            which can lead to poor breathing, incorrect alignment, and injury. Online yoga classes and tutorial
            videos have gained popularity, but they lack real-time feedback and correction. The study aims to
            provide real-time advice and feedback to address these issues and make yoga instruction more
            accessible and of higher quality. The research challenge is to create a novel system that offers
            realtime coaching to
            practitioners, improving their performance and preventing accidents. The
            proposed approach aims to improve alignment and breathing, enhance learning experiences, and
            increase the efficacy of yoga practice by offering 3D renderings of genuine asanas and real-time
            feedback, including error checking. This approach aims to make yoga instruction more accessible
            and useful for practitioners of all skill levels. -->

            <span class="start-with-bold">T</span>he research project aims to suggest an effective and accurate yoga
            asana based on user requests,
            recognizing the physical and mental benefits of different yoga asanas and adapting them to meet
            individual needs. The real-time yoga assistant will assess the user's posture and movement using
            computer vision and machine learning techniques to suggest areas that need attention. The goal is
            to improve health and well-being by supporting safer and more effective yoga practice.
            Technology improvements are crucial for making yoga more effective, personalized, and
            accessible to a wider range of users, including beginners and those with unique health issues. The
            real-time yoga assistant will need increased precision, accuracy, and overall efficiency in computer
            vision to predict human positions during yoga asanas. For beginners, current algorithms and
            systems often lack the ability to offer individualized and trustworthy feedback. To enable safer
            and more effective yoga practice, the research challenge necessitates the creation and improvement
            of computer vision algorithms, user-friendly interfaces, and personalization strategies.
