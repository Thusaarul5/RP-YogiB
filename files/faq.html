                <div>
                    Hardly. All you need is a nonslip yoga mat that is long enough to
                    lay fully stretched on your back.

                <div>
                    Meditation can be practiced every day. Beginners can target 5-10
                    mins a day, and those with more experience can work up to 30-60 mins
                    twice a day or more.

                <div>
                    Yes! Everyone can do Yoga, and there is no limit to who can or who
                    cannot. You may feel intimidated or discouraged seeing a lot of
                    performative Yoga on social media, but please know that such extreme
                    flexibility is unnecessary to get the benefits of Yoga.

                <summary>How are Yoga Asanas different from exercise?</summary>
                <div>
                    Exercises focus more on physical strength and the ability to do
                    strenuous tasks. Regular exercise helps you develop greater control
                    over your movements and range of motion. Yoga is a mind-body
                    practice that focuses more on mental wellness and your ability to
                    consciously relax the body, regulate emotions, develop greater
                    self-control, and improve concentration.

                <summary>What are the benefits of yoga?</summary>
                <div>
                    Practising yoga has loads of physical benefits: it creates a flexible, toned and strong body and
                    improves breathing,
                    energy and metabolism. Yoga improves circulatory and cardiac health, as well as fitness levels, pain
                    and posture. It
                    also has benefits for your mental health, making you happier, more balanced and emotionally calmer.
                    It helps you relax
                    so you can handle stress better. Yoga encourages self-confidence and helps you to focus your energy.

                <div>
                    Even if you practice once a week, you’ll feel the difference. If you can, try to practice two to
                    three times a week but
                    don’t let unrealistic expectations stop you from doing shorter practices. 10 or 20 minutes is better
                    than doing nothing
                    at all. In short, do what you can, when you can. Focus on, and be proud of what you do, rather than
                    focusing on what you
                    think you should be doing.
